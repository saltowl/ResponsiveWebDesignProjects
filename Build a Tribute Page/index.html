          Thom Yorke describes his excellent new solo album Anima as “dystopian,” which isn’t
          exactly the hugest surprise in the world. With or without Radiohead, he’s spent his whole
          career mapping out the dystopia we’re living in—he does futuristic apocalypse the way John
          Fogerty does choogle. Yorke could have spent the entire record freestyling new verses for
          “Old Town Road” and it still would have turned out dystopian. But nobody could accuse him
          of overreacting. At a moment when the world is in even scarier shape than the last time
          Radiohead took its temperature, on 2016’s A Moon Shaped Pool, he’s moved on to new
          nightmares.

          Anima is 48 minutes of abstract electro confessionals, written and produced in close
          collaboration with Nigel Godrich in a fit of Flying Lotus-inspired experimentation. Within
          the first few minutes, Yorke’s digitally warped voice is gulping “I can’t breathe” and
          “there’s no water” over “Idioteque”-style synth swerves and glitch-wave percussion loops.
          He’s tapping into anxieties both geopolitical and personal. It’s “woke,” but in the sense
          of “sleep-deprived so long the fluttering of your eyelids booms like kettledrums,” and
          that realm of paranoid body-freezing anxiety is the zone where Yorke feels right at home.
