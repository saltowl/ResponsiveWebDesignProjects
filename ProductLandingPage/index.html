            From the first note, Piaggero will amaze you with its compact size and the high-quality
            voices it features, from the beautiful, rich tones sampled from one of Yamaha’s finest
            concert grand pianos, to a sweet electric piano and other great-sounding voices that are
            fun to play. The NP-32 features a “Graded Soft Touch keyboard” with keys in the bass
            register having a heavier feel while the high notes are lighter. It's amazingly natural
            and expressive, and you can take it anywhere to play.

            you to play at their parties! Because it’s light enough to be carried in one hand and
            works on battery power, you can take it anywhere you want, and setup is a breeze.
