        The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional
        layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an
        interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main
        features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides.
        When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox
        deals with layout in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can be
        contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and
        rows together.
      </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_two_axes_of_flexbox">
        <header><h2>The two axes of flexbox</h2></header>
        <p>
          When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the
          cross axis. The main axis is defined by the <code>flex-direction</code> property, and the
          cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these
          axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.
        </p>
        <h3>The main axis</h3>
        <p>
          The main axis is defined by <code>flex-direction</code>, which has four possible values:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>row</code></li>
          <li><code>row-reverse</code></li>
          <li><code>column</code></li>
          <li><code>column-reverse</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Should you choose <code>row</code> or <code>row-reverse</code>, your main axis will run
          along the row in the <b>inline direction</b>.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15614/Basics1.png"
          alt="Main Axis - flex-direction: row"
        />
        <p>
          Choose <code>column</code> or <code>column-reverse</code> and your main axis will run from
          the top of the page to the bottom — in the <b>block direction</b>.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15615/Basics2.png"
          alt="Main Axis - flex-direction: column"
        />
        <h3>The cross axis</h3>
        <p>
          The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your
          <code>flex-direction</code> (main axis) is set to <code>row</code> or
          <code>row-reverse</code> the cross axis runs down the columns.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15616/Basics3.png"
          alt="Cross Axis - flex-direction: row"
        />
        <p>
          If your main axis is <code>column</code> or <code>column-reverse</code> then the cross
          axis runs along the rows.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15617/Basics4.png"
          alt="Cross Axis - flex-direction: column"
        />
        <p>
          Understanding which axis is which is important when we start to look at aligning and
          justifying flex items; flexbox features properties that align and justify content along
          one axis or the other.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Start_and_end_lines">
        <header><h2>Start and end lines</h2></header>
        <p>
          Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing
          mode of the document. In the past, CSS was heavily weighted towards horizontal and
          left-to-right writing modes. Modern layout methods encompass the range of writing modes
          and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a document
          and run towards the right hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can read more about the relationship between flexbox and the Writing Modes
          specification in a later article, however the following description should help explain
          why we do not talk about left and right and top and bottom when we describe the direction
          that our flex items flow in.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <code>flex-direction</code> is <code>row</code> and I am working in English, then
          the start edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the right.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15618/Basics5.png"
          alt="The main axis on the left, the end edge on the right"
        />
        <p>
          If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be on the right and
          the end edge on the left.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15619/Basics6.png"
          alt="The main axis on the right, the end edge on the left"
        />
        <p>
          In both cases the start edge of the cross axis is at the top of the flex container and the
          end edge at the bottom, as both languages have a horizontal writing mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a while, thinking about start and end rather than left and right becomes natural,
          and will be useful to you when dealing with other layout methods such as CSS Grid Layout
          which follow the same patterns.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_flex_container">
        <header><h2>The flex container</h2></header>
        <p>
          An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a <b>flex container</b>. To create
          a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's <code>display</code> property
          to <code>flex</code> or <code>inline-flex</code>. As soon as we do this the direct
          children of that container become <b>flex items</b>. As with all properties in CSS, some
          initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex
          items will behave in the following way.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Items display in a row (the <code>flex-direction</code> property's default is
            <code>row</code>).
          </li>
          <li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li>
          <li>The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.</li>
          <li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
          <li>The <code>flex-basis</code> property is set to <code>auto</code>.</li>
          <li>The <code>flex-wrap</code> property is set to <code>nowrap</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the
          content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the
          container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than
          others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full size.
        </p>
        <h3>Changing flex-direction</h3>
        <p>
          Adding the <code>flex-direction</code> property to the flex container allows us to change
          the direction in which our flex items display. Setting
          <code>flex-direction: row-reverse</code> will keep the items displaying along the row,
          however the start and end lines are switched.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we change <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> the main axis switches and
          our items now display in a column. Set <code>column-reverse</code> and the start and end
          lines are again switched.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Multi-line_flex_containers_with_flex-wrap">
        <header><h2>Multi-line flex containers with flex-wrap</h2></header>
        <p>
          While flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to cause our flex items to wrap
          onto multiple lines. In doing so, you should consider each line as a new flex container.
          Any space distribution will happen across that line, without reference to the lines either
          side.
        </p>
        <p>
          To cause wrapping behaviour add the property <code>flex-wrap</code> with a value of
          <code>wrap</code>. Now, should your items be too large to all display in one line, they
          will wrap onto another line. The live sample below contains items that have been given a
          width, the total width of the items being too wide for the flex container. As
          <code>flex-wrap</code> is set to <code>wrap</code> the items wrap. Set it to
          <code>nowrap</code>, which is also the initial value, and they will instead shrink to fit
          the container because they are using initial flexbox values that allows items to shrink.
          Using <code>nowrap</code> would cause an overflow if the items were not able to shrink, or
          could not shrink small enough to fit.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_flex-flow_shorthand">
        <header><h2>The flex-flow shorthand</h2></header>
        <p>
          You can combine the two properties <code>flex-direction</code> and
          <code>flex-wrap</code> into the <code>flex-flow</code> shorthand. The first value
          specified is <code>flex-direction</code> and the second value is <code>flex-wrap</code>.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Properties_applied_to_flex_items">
        <header><h2>Properties applied to flex items</h2></header>
        <p>
          To have more control over flex items we can target them directly. We do this by way of
          three properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="#flex-grow"><code>flex-grow</code></a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#flex-shrink"><code>flex-shrink</code></a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="#flex-basis"><code>flex-basis</code></a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will take a brief look at these properties in this overview, and you can gain a fuller
          understanding in the guide
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Controlling_Ratios_of_Flex_Items_Along_the_Main_Ax"
            >Controlling Ratios of Flex Items on the Main Axis</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the concept of
          <b>available space</b>. What we are doing when we change the value of these flex
          properties is to change the way that available space is distributed amongst our items.
          This concept of available space is also important when we come to look at aligning items.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500 pixels wide, then the
          space we need to lay out our items is 300 pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available
          space. If we don’t change the initial values then flexbox will put that space after the
          last item.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15620/Basics7.png"
          alt="Container and the available space"
        />
        <p>
          If we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then we need to have a
          method of distributing the leftover space between the items. This is what the
          <code>flex</code> properties that we apply to the items themselves, will do.
        </p>
        <h3 id="flex-basis">The flex-basis property</h3>
        <p>
          The <code>flex-basis</code> is what defines the size of that item in terms of the space it
          leaves as available space. The initial value of this property is <code>auto</code> — in
          this case the browser looks to see if the items have a size. In the example above, all of
          the items have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the <code>flex-basis</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the items don’t have a size then the content's size is used as the flex-basis. This is
          why when we just declare <code>display: flex</code> on the parent to create flex items,
          the items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their
          contents.
        </p>
        <h3 id="flex-grow">The flex-grow property</h3>
        <p>
          With the <code>flex-grow</code> property set to a positive integer, flex items can grow
          along the main axis from their <code>flex-basis</code>. This will cause the item to
          stretch and take up any available space on that axis, or a proportion of the available
          space if other items are allowed to grow too.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we gave all of our items in the example above a <code>flex-grow</code> value of 1 then
          the available space in the flex container would be equally shared between our items and
          they would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in proportion. If we give our first
          item a <code>flex-grow</code> value of 2 and the other items a value of 1, 2 parts will be
          given to the first item (100px out of 200px in the case of the example above), 1 part each
          the other two (50px each out of the 200px total).
        </p>
        <h3 id="flex-shrink">The flex-shrink property</h3>
        <p>
          Where the <code>flex-grow</code> property deals with adding space in the main axis, the
          <code>flex-shrink</code> property controls how it is taken away. If we do not have enough
          space in the container to lay out our items and <code>flex-shrink</code> is set to a
          positive integer the item can become smaller than the <code>flex-basis</code>. As with
          <code>flex-grow</code> different values can be assigned in order to cause one item to
          shrink faster than others — an item with a higher value set for
          <code>flex-shrink</code> will shrink faster than its siblings that have lower values.
        </p>
        <p>
          The minimum size of the item will be taken into account while working out the actual
          amount of shrinkage that will happen, which means that flex-shrink has the potential to
          appear less consistent than flex-grow in behavior. We’ll therefore take a more detailed
          look at how this algorithm works in the article Controlling Ratios of items along the main
          axis.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          Note that these values for <code>flex-grow</code> and <code>flex-shrink</code> are
          proportions. Typically if we had all of our items set to flex: <code>1 1 200px</code> and
          then wanted one item to grow at twice the rate, we would set that item to flex:
          <code>2 1 200px</code>. However you could use flex: <code>10 1 200px</code> and flex:
          <code>20 1 200px</code> if you wanted.
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Shorthand values for the flex properties</h3>
        <p>
          You will very rarely see the <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>, and
          <code>flex-basis</code> properties used individually; instead they are combined into the
          <code>flex</code> shorthand. The <code>flex</code> shorthand allows you to set the three
          values in this order — <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>,
          <code>flex-basis</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of the use cases. You
          will often see these used in tutorials, and in many cases these are all you will need to
          use. The predefined values are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>flex: initial</code></li>
          <li><code>flex: auto</code></li>
          <li><code>flex: none</code></li>
          <li><code>flex: &lt;positive-number&gt;</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Setting <code>flex: initial</code> resets the item to the initial values of Flexbox. This
          is the same as <code>flex: 0 1 auto</code>. In this case the value of
          <code>flex-grow</code> is 0, so items will not grow larger than their
          <code>flex-basis</code> size. The value of <code>flex-shrink</code> is 1, so items can
          shrink if they need to rather than overflowing. The value of <code>flex-basis</code> is
          <code>auto</code>. Items will either use any size set on the item in the main dimension,
          or they will get their size from the content size.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <code>flex: auto</code> is the same as using <code>flex: 1 1 auto</code>; everything
          is as with <code>flex:initial</code> but in this case the items can grow and fill the
          container as well as shrink if required.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <code>flex: none</code> will create fully inflexible flex items. It is as if you
          wrote <code>flex: 0 0 auto</code>. The items cannot grow or shrink but will be laid out
          using flexbox with a <code>flex-basis</code> of <code>auto</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shorthand you often see in tutorials is <code>flex: 1</code> or
          <code>flex: 2</code> and so on. This is as if you used <code>flex: 1 1 0</code>. The items
          can grow and shrink from a <code>flex-basis</code> of 0.

          <h2>Alignment, justification and distribution of free space between items</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          A key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items on the main- and
          cross-axes, and to distribute space between flex items.
        </p>
        <h3><code>align-items</code></h3>
        <p>The <code>align-items</code> property will align the items on the cross axis.</p>
        <p>
          The initial value for this property is <code>stretch</code> and this is why flex items
          stretch to the height of the tallest one by default. They are in fact stretching to fill
          the flex container — the tallest item is defining the height of that.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could instead set <code>align-items</code> to <code>flex-start</code> in order to make
          the items line up at the start of the flex container, <code>flex-end</code> to align them
          to the end, or center to align them in the centre. Try this in the live example — I have
          given the flex container a height in order that you can see how the items can be moved
          around inside the container.
        </p>
        <h3><code>justify-content</code></h3>
        <p>
          The <code>justify-content</code> property is used to align the items on the main axis, the
          direction in which <code>flex-direction</code> has set the flow. The initial value is
          <code>flex-start</code> which will line the items up at the start edge of the container,
          but you could also set the value to <code>flex-end</code> to line them up at the end, or
          <code>center</code> to line them up in the centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also use the value <code>space-between</code> to take all the spare space after
          the items have been laid out, and share it out evenly between the items so there will be
          an equal amount of space between each item. To cause an equal amount of space on the right
          and left of each item use the value <code>space-around</code>. With
          <code>space-around</code>, items have a half-size space on either end. Or, to cause items
          to have equal space around them use the value <code>space-evenly</code>. With
          <code>space-evenly</code>, items have a full-size space on either end.

          we will explore these properties in more depth, in order to have a better understanding of
          how they work. These simple examples however will be useful in the majority of use cases.
